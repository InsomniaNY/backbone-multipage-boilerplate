<div id="fireflypage">

    <p>This page is an example of event driven architecture.</p>

    <p>Click on an item below and it will move to the other container. An item will either take on text form or
    image form depending upon which container it is in. Each container is controlled by a separate and different nested view.
    Each of the views remembers its state in case you navigate away to another page.</p>

    <p> When an item is clicked the view takes care of itself, removing the item from its model,
     sending the event to Grand Central and finally rerendering according to the models new content.</p>

    <p>You'll notice that in the code definition this.render() does not exist, also $el does not exist until
        its assigned during runtime. This is to show you that during instanciation,
        <span class="codestyle">initialize()</span> is the only method required by the Backbone framework.
    </p>

    <p>The last thing to note is that the code for these views is not stored in <span class="codestyle">/views-special</span>
    I chose to do this because its not instanciated on different pages.  Instead each view is instanciated once and is specific
    to the FireFly page experience.  Therefore it makes sense to store the javascript in <span class="codestyle">/firefly</span>
    along with the main file. Also JS filenames don't make a difference and are ignored at compile time, I could have put all three views
        in the one JS file and it would be the same.</p>
