    <p>This is a basic page. All html, css and javascript for this page is stored in the home view folder in <span class="codestyle">/public/views-pages</span></p>

    <p>Below are links and summaries of the other pages in the boilerplate.</p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/gameofthrones">The Game of Thrones Page</a>
        - here is an example showing how css can completely break away from the
        css pattern discussed on the home page. It also shows an extra render panel.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/walkingdead">Walking Dead Page</a>
        - an example showing how to combine deeplinks with
        pulling data from the config. The browsers back button works with the deeplinks.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/dexter">Dexter and True Blood</a>
        - here you can see how a sub-view that is html only
        can be recylced and used across multiple pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/hannibal">Hannibal and Breaking Bad</a>
        - here is an example showing how we can nest
    javascript views. The same view with javascript instanciates on each page.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/firefly">Firefly</a>
        - this page has two nested views that communicate to each other
        using event architecture. I've named the event dispatcher grandCentral.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="pagetitle" href="#/madmax">Mad Max</a>
        - this page gives an example of how the loaderView works in conjunction with the BBPreload library.
    </p>
