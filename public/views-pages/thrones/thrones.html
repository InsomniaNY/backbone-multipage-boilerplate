    <p>All the other pages follow specific css pattern. The purpose of this page is
        to demonstrate that this has nothing to do with how javascript
        identifies the html to inject.</p>

    <p>In this framework the page's html is identified by the filename and accessed though the
        htmlpartials object. If you inspect element or look at the html code you will see this is the case.</p>
